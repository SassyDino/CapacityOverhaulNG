# INFO AND GUIDANCE:
# - Ensure that the mod name is spelt correctly, and that the file extension is correct (esp/esl/esm).
#
# - The names of the items are not required to be exact for the mod to recognise them, but it is helpful to ensure that they
#   are at least identifiable and in the correct order, for clarity and readability.
#
# However, it IS important that the Form IDs provided are correct, and formatted as expected by the mod:
# - For ESLs and ESL-flagged ESPs (i.e. Form IDs beginning with "FE"), "0x" should be followed by the last three characters 
#   of the item's full 8-character FormID: e.g. the Form ID "FE017B18" would be written here as "0xB18".
# - For ESPs and ESMs, "0x" should be followed by the last six characters of the item's full 8-character Form ID: e.g.
#   the Form ID "3B2C821E" would be written as "0x2C821E".
# - When written into a config file for this mod, Form IDs MUST be prefixed with "0x".
# - Optionally, leading zeroes may be removed, such that "0x00A" or "0x00000A" may be written as "0xA" etc.
# 
# The following storage categories are all of the valid options that may be added to a group of items:
# - "huge", "large", "medium", "small", "tiny", "alchemy", "ammo", "coins", "weaponlarge", "weaponmedium", "weaponsmall", "weaponranged", "shield"
# - To add a capacity bonus to a storage item (or group of storage items), insert a new line in the group you wish to create/edit, with
#   "capacity" followed by the category you wish to add the bonus for, and separated by a period ("capacity.ammo", "capacity.weaponranged", etc.)
# - Note that, as per normal mod behaviour, tiny, small, medium, large, and (depending on mod settings) huge categories all share
#   the same "space". Therefore, adding a capacity bonus to "large" items will also increase the capacity available for medium,
#   small, and tiny items, etc.
#
# Also note that indentation does not matter for this config file (but it does help readability!).
# For more information on TOML syntax, read here: https://toml.io/
